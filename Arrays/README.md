## What is an Array
An Array is a collection of items. The items could be integers, strings, DVDs, games, booksâ€”anything really. The items are stored in neighboring (contiguous) memory locations. Because they're stored together, checking through the entire collection of items is straightforward.


## Creating an Array
`
creating an array of defined length with Array constructor
    const arr =  new Array(5);

creating an array with square brakcets
    const arr = [];
`
## Writing Items into an Array
`
writing to a given index index
    arr[index] = value

writing at the end of array
    arr.push(value);
`

## Reading items from Array
`
read value from a given index
    const value = arr[index]
`

## Higher order in built array function 

### Array.map(fn)
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

const doubleArr =  arr.map(a=> 2*a)
